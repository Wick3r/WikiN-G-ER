Record Floods Force More Evacuations in Serbia

Much of Serbia, Bosnia and Eastern Croatia Are Underwater
MOROVIC, Serbia—Two villages were evacuated in northwestern Serbia on Tuesday out of fear that the waters of the swollen Sava would spill over into smaller rivers.
That latest threat in the worst Balkan flooding in memory arose as the result of a dam break last week in neighboring Croatia.
The flood water was expected to feed into the already high Studva and Bosut rivers at the village of Morovic, near the town of Sid on the border with Croatia. The wave was expected to peak on Tuesday night, according to Nikola Vidic, spokesman of the crisis staff for the Sid area.
"We've taken all the preventive measures and now we're praying to God," Mr. Vidic said.
Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia's prime minister, ordered three days of national mourning, starting Wednesday, to remember more than 50 people who died as a result of the disaster that shows no signs of abating.
The flooding has triggered a massive evacuation in Serbia, Bosnia, and Eastern Croatia. Hundreds of thousands have been left without drinking water.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Tuesday that the flooding caused severe damage across the Balkans and hit businesses, housing and infrastructure.
"Much of Bosnia and Herzegovina, eastern Croatia and Serbia are underwater with an imminent threat of spillover into the neighboring countries," the bank said, adding it would consider increasing its investment program for the Balkans beyond the €1.2 billion ($1.64 billion) originally planned for this year.
In the Sid area, 5,200 people had been evacuated from three villages by late Tuesday.
"We have already taken the kids to Sid, but we're staying on, working," said Tamara Djukic, a shopkeeper in Morovic.
Serbian police put up road blocks Tuesday to prevent residents from returning to the flood-ravaged town of Obrenovac, as a second deluge within days slowly receded and officials began the grim search for more bodies.
The Sava peaked overnight in the town at the confluence of two rivers, already the hardest hit by the worst flooding on record in Bosnia and Serbia. A surge of floodwater over the weekend from the Kolubara river had already washed away cars and killed at least 13 people around Obrenovac.
Authorities had pushed to evacuate some 20,000 residents of the town and nearby villages before the flood but many people stayed. Officials searched for more bodies and animal corpses on Tuesday and said they were concerned that infectious diseases could spread.
Evacuees arriving by bus at a sports hall turned shelter in Belgrade on Monday evening described the first flood as coming so quickly that people had little time to respond.
Mirjana Savic, 45, said she could hear houses cracking under the weight of the water and escaped her home by boat.
"The water was so high I had to put my head down to avoid power lines in the street," she said.
An Obrenovac resident who identified himself as Mihajlo said he asked authorities to allow him to go back to the town to let his dog off his leash at home but he wasn't allowed to do it.
"My car is still there, but I'm more worried about Mali; he's an excellent dog," he said.
The Sava was expected to peak in Belgrade late Tuesday or Wednesday, but officials have said there is no danger of flooding. River banks in the city were reinforced with thousands of sandbags.
The mayor ordered all neon signs to be switched off to save power, leaving the city darker than usual on Monday night. Serbia is importing power because hydroelectric plants produce less electricity with all floodgates open.
The thermoelectric plant near Obrenovac was operating at a minimum but switching it off altogether would have an unpredictable outcome, the spokesman of state-owned power firm Elektroprivreda Srbije said.
The flood reduced power generation in Serbia by some 40%, according to the EBRD.
Mr. Vucic, the Serbian prime minister, said it was difficult to estimate material damages from the flooding, but he assumed that it would "exceed hundreds of millions of euros, perhaps even one billion euros."
The damage to roads and other infrastructure will cause major problems for the free movement of goods and people and is likely to affect small businesses across the region disproportionately.
In Umka, a town between Obrenovac and Belgrade, locals were afraid Tuesday the water levels would climb further as the Danube was set to reach its peak in Belgrade over the weekend.
"We're not allowing the kids to go to school, just to make sure," said Marija Radulovic, a 39-year-old translator.
"We have a bag packed with the essentials; toothbrushes, some clothes and we're taking the laptops, too," Ms. Radulovic said.
Information from authorities has been contradictory, she said. The family was awaiting news on a possible evacuation but hadn't been instructed to move out of their house. "When I see the water rising in the backyard, we'll escape uphill to Belgrade," she said.
